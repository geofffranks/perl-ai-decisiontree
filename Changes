Revision history for Perl extension AI::DecisionTree.

0.02

 - Added support for noisy data, currently by picking the best (most
   common) result when noise is encountered.  See the 'noise_mode'
   parameter to new().

 - Added the rule_tree() method, which returns a data structure
   representing the tree. [James Smith]

 - Significantly sped up the train() method, especially for large data
   sets.

 - The get_result() method is no longer implemented recursively, which
   simplifies it and speeds it up.

 - Reformatted the documentation and added a TO DO section.

 - Documented the nodes() method.
